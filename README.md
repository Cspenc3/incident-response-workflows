# Incident Response Workflows

A curated collection of **incident response playbooks, templates, and postmortems** aligned with [NIST SP 800-61r2](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf).  
This repository demonstrates my ability to **detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents**, while documenting lessons learned for long-term architectural improvements.

## 📌 Contents
- **Playbooks** – Step-by-step guides for responding to phishing, malware, ransomware, and cloud-related incidents.  
- **Templates** – Standardized forms for incident reports, executive summaries, and communication plans.  
- **Postmortems** – Example after-action reports documenting root causes, business impact, and architecture recommendations.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice and demonstrate **incident handling skills** across multiple attack scenarios.  
- Develop **reusable templates** for consistent IR documentation.  
- Build a **portfolio** aligned with roles such as *Intrusion Analyst II* and *Incident Response Analyst*.  
- Showcase the ability to link incidents to **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** and propose **preventive architecture improvements**.

## 🧭 How to Use This Repo
1. Explore the `playbooks/` folder for incident handling guides.  
2. Use the `templates/` folder to standardize your reporting and communication.  
3. Review `postmortems/` for examples of lessons learned and recommendations.  
4. Apply these workflows to labs, simulations, or real-world incidents.  

---

## 📈 Roadmap
- Add new playbooks (Insider Threat, Cloud IAM Abuse, Lateral Movement).  
- Expand postmortems with additional scenarios from practice labs.  
- Automate parts of the workflow with Python scripts (IOC extraction, timeline generation).
